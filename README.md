Odin Recipe Test Project
This is my first full blown HTML project! I will be following the Odin Project guidelines step by step to complete this project. At the end of the project, I should be able to code a robust HTML site start to finish.

The site certainly won't be pretty, but it once I learn CSS, I will revisit this project to add some styling and doctor it up a bit.
