    <h2>How to cook perfect chicken breast, every time.</h2>
    <p>It's no secret that chicken breast is tricky to get right. Being able to whip up perfectly moist chicken breast every time is almost a party trick. Well, that's exactly what this recipe is going to teach you how to do.</p>
   <p>To start, we'll need just a few things:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>1lb boneless, skinless chicken breast</li> 
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Preparation</h3>
   <p>To prepare and cook your dish, follow the steps listed below!</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees</li>
    <li>Drizzle olive oil over your chicken breast</li>
    <li>Generously apply salt to your chicken breast</li>
    <li>Add some pepper (don't be shy if you like a bit of heat!)</li>
    <li>Turn your chicken breast, apply olive oil, salt, and pepper to the other side.</li>
    <li>Once preheated, place your chicken in the oven for 25 minutes. Pro tip: if you have a food thermometer, pull your chicken from the oven at <em>exactly</em>165 degrees internal temperature.</li>
    <li>Slice your chicken <strong>immediately</strong> once you pull it from the oven. This is where people let their chicken overcook! It will continue cooking due to the built up heat, so to preserve moisture, it's important to slice it right away</li>
   </ol>
   <p>And that's it! Enjoy your chicken! This is a healthy, easy to prepare protien that can be paired with any kind of vegetable or carbohydrate. See below for another delicious, simple recipe!</p>
